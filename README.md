# Git-Homework-OOP

This homework revises a homework Vehicle register.

During a revisition some changes to code have been made.
The changes mainly focused on additional commenting and
simplification of some functions, mainly in area of 
usage of return flags.

Overall the original code was OK and understandable,
however some changes were made to go more with the theme of 
pyhon.

Accordance to PEP 8 was also OK, thanks to usage of pycharm.
